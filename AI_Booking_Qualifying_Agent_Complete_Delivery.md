## ðŸŽ“ Key Features of Your Agent

### âœ… Permission-Based Qualification

```
"I'd love to help you find the right home. Before I get you scheduled, 
can I ask you just a few quick questions? It'll help me match you with 
the right agent. Sound good?"
```

Why: Sounds helpful, not screening. Reduces hangups dramatically.

### âœ… Soft Question Phrasing

```
âŒ "When are you looking to move?"
âœ… "So when are you hoping to make a move?"

âŒ "What's your budget?"
âœ… "And what price range are you thinking?"
```

Why: Conversational tone vs. interrogative tone.

### âœ… Smart Booking Decision Tree

```
If pre-approved + urgent â†’ Book NOW
If pre-approved + reasonable timeline â†’ Book within 48 hours
If interested but not ready â†’ Nurture path
If just browsing â†’ Polite redirect with resources
```

### âœ… Arizona Market Intelligence

- **Solar leases:** Knows DTI impact, escalator clauses, vendors
- **Water systems:** Understands municipal vs. hauled water
- **HOA/STR:** Knows Arizona's rental restrictions vary
- **Multi-generational:** Casita, suegra unit, nana's room terminology
- **Corporate relocations:** Intel, TSMC, Amazon context

### âœ… Bilingual Capability

- Code-switches naturally (English â†” Spanglish)
- Uses Southwest Spanish terms (carro, computadora, not coche/ordenador)
- Can switch to full Spanish if needed ("Â¿Prefieres hablar en espaÃ±ol?")

### âœ… Complete Objection Handling

- "I'm not ready yet" â†’ Resources + nurture
- "Why all the questions?" â†’ Explains benefit
- "Market is expensive" â†’ Offers lender connection
- "Worried about solar" â†’ Reassures + education
- Every common pushback has a response

## ðŸ“ž What A Perfect Call Sounds Like

```
Agent: "Hi there! Thanks for calling Desert Realty. I'm here to help you 
        find your perfect home in Arizona. What's your name?"

Caller: "Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm thinking about buying a home."

Agent: "Awesome, Sarah! Congratulations on looking! I'd love to help you 
        find the right place. Before I get you scheduled with one of our 
        agents, can I ask you just a few quick questions? It'll help me 
        match you with someone who specializes in exactly what you're 
        looking for. Sound good?"

Caller: "Sure, that's fine."

Agent: "Perfect! So when are you hoping to make a move?"

Caller: "We're hoping to buy in the next 3 months."

Agent: "Oh nice! That's a good timeline. And what's bringing you to 
        Arizona?"

Caller: "My husband got a job with Intel, so we're relocating from 
        California."

Agent: "Oh great! Congratulations to him! Are you relocating for Intel? 
        We actually have several agents who specialize in helping corporate 
        relocations and really know the Intel corridor around Chandler and 
        Tempe. That's perfect.

        So just so I can show you realistic optionsâ€”what budget are you 
        working with?"

Caller: "We're looking around $450,000 to $550,000."

Agent: "Perfect range. And have you connected with a lender yet, or is 
        that something you'd like help with?"

Caller: "Yeah, we're actually pre-approved already."

Agent: "Excellent! That makes things so much easier. So based on what 
        you've sharedâ€”Intel relocation, $450-550K budget, pre-approved, 
        looking in the Chandler/Tempe areaâ€”I actually have an agent who 
        specializes in exactly this. She's fantastic with corporate 
        relocations. Let me get you on her calendar. Do you have your 
        phone handy? I can text you a link to book your appointment right 
        now."

Caller: "Yes, absolutely!"

Agent: "Great! [Sends link] You should see it pop up. Pick whatever time 
        works best for you. She'll reach out to confirm. You're all set, 
        Sarah!"
